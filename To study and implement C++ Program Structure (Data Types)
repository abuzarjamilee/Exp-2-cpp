To study and implement C++ Program Structure (Data Types)

Theory: -
In C++, variables are declared using data type to restrict storage type. 
The compiler allocates memory based on the data type, which requires different memory allocations. 
C++ supports various data types, including Character (char), Integer (int), Boolean (bool), Floating point (float),
Double Floating point (double), Void (), and Wide Character sizeof() operator. These data types can have modifiers, such as Short Long 
Signed Unsigned, which can increase or decrease the variable's size. For example, Long can extend an integer to 4 bytes. The storage representation
and machine instructions for each data type differ from machine to machine.
